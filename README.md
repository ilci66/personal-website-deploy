# This will probably serve as my portfolio website
* I can't think of anything I wanna do here that will require a dynamic website, so not gonna use pug.js or react 
* Dockerized
* Don't wanna use a css library for this one
* Saw some method called "Atomic Design", even though my desings suck I wanna give that one a try
* Gonna seperate the scss later as the website grows
* Colors are out of control, going with a smaller, palette
* Not gonna use the sass library I created a while back, writing all brand new
* I want to save the information send by the user via the contact form in my mongodb cloud database 
# Basic responsiveness done
* planning on running webpack for my backend too but apparently I can't have multiple  configs for for multple entries and outputs, so probably I will just run it once to bundle my backend before production
